# ðŸŒ¿ Algerian Medicinal Herbs Project

An open-source initiative to catalog and classify Algerian medicinal herbs and their benefits, as a first step toward building an AI-powered identification model.

## ðŸ“– List of Studied Herbs

| Herb | Main Benefit | Common Uses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mint** | Aids digestion | Refreshing tea, relieves colic |
| **Chamomile** | Reduces stress | Calming tea, treats insomnia |
| **Rosemary** | Improves memory | Cooking spice, natural stimulant |

## ðŸŽ¯ End Goal
Develop an artificial intelligence model that can:
- Identify herbs from images
- Provide information about their benefits
- Help preserve Algerian medical heritage

## ðŸ“Š Project Roadmap
- [x] Gather information about herbs
- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Collect herb images (dataset)
- [ ] Build AI model prototype
- [ ] Train and test the model
